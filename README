Hello,

This application is just a homework but i think this is a good example to learn Custom ListView, Custom ExpandableListView and Custom Spinner.

Also it contains a good example of SharedPreference and Custom DialogBox.

If you're new at Android, this is a really good example for you.

Feel free to ask me anything which you cannot understand.

Note : I'm sorry that i had no time to fix all code quality and some issues but still feel free to ask me and fix me about anything.

Happy Coding :)
